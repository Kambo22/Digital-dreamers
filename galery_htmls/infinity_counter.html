                    <p>The Infinity Counter aka The Machine that Counts Nothing, to
                        Infinity.</p>
                    <p>The infinity counter is a machine that counts nothing from zero
                        til infinity. Thus gives a purpose on doing nothing and makes
                        nothing count for something.</p>
                    <p>The viewer participates by activating the mechanism by pressing
                        the switch.</p>
                    <p>The installation comes to life. Lights turn on, liquids run
                        through the tubes and the meter starts counting. The action is
                        imprinted there.</p>
                    <p>Technology has shaped a fast and ever-changing digital landscape
                        that affects and sets new norms on life. Whether it defines our
                        entertainment, our relationships, our ways of working while
                        generally dealing with information, it puts us into a new numeral
                        modality defined by “counting”. Our devices record our performance
                        when we work or while doing sports. Our favorite apps — to which
                        we are so much committed — count our friends, our talent and
                        social acceptance through likes and emojis while residing in such
                        a small touch screen apparatus which we keep in our pockets, never
                        letting our minds adrift. In a way, humans have turned partially
                        into machines.</p>
                    <p>The Infinity Counter is an apparatus that embraces “doing
                        nothing”. Realizing that Nothing Moments deserve our attention,
                        the machine takes on that awkward Nothing Moments while creating a
                        space for it, inviting people to live through it, instead of
                        marginalizing it. At the same time, it triggers its user to be
                        productive while doing nothing. A speedometer counts this “nothing
                        time” suggesting a surreal law of physics between “nothing time”
                        and speed. Intentionally a low tech machine, with an organic form,
                        aims to sympathize with humans while all actions taking place
                        produce Nothing. In a high tech society this is a speculative aid
                        machine that helps us unplug.</p>
                    <p>The machine consists of mechanical car parts and consumables
                        (antifreezant) obtaining an organic form and compose a simulation
                        of vital functions mechanism.</p>
