              Egkivotismos is a site specific project about the relationship
              between the first steam electro power plant in Athens and Kifissos
              river flowing right next to it. The establishment of the power
              plant in 1905 launched the development of an industrial area
              around it and defined the riverâ€™s character as an industrial
              river.
            </p>
            <p class="short-info">
              The project focuses on the first decade of the 21st century. It is
              the time when the roof of the plant facilities is removed, as it
              is made of asbestos a toxic material, allowing eventually the
              natural elements to enter and conquer it. Trees are now growing
              successfully inside of it attracting a whole new ecosystem. In the
              same years the river went under a great change by developers as it
              was enclosed with cement and a highway was built upon it. The
              landscape changed, the natural ecosystem was destroyed and the
              river now flows inside a cement canal. From a point of view, at
              the same time, the plant returned to nature while the river was
              captured.
            </p>
            <p class="short-info">
              Interested in this reversal of roles I consider these contrasting
              elements as part of one ecosystem, with symbiosis, conflicts,
              natural and artificial organisms.
            </p>
            <p class="short-info">
              The installation is a material narrative using the main elements
              of this ecosystem. Vestiges of the factory, personal items of the
              workers, newly native plants and finally the water depicted in
              captivating forms (inside a plastic bag, or out of scale levels
              referring to its use as a tool) construct this installation. The
              installation is a bit of a stratigraphy, a bit of a museum
              display, with various materials balancing each other trying to
              preserve this strange new nature. The installation is accompanied
              with photographs from the interior of the plant, sketches that
              show the reversal of roles taking place under
              alchemo-socio-politico-economical reactions and a map of the plant
              depicting the story as I heard it.
