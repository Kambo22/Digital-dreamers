              <p> A research project on the notion of change using the archaeology
                process as a starting point to trace the relationship between
                memory and the transformative dynamics of places.</p>
              <p>The natural element of water has defined the shape of the location
                in different ways over the centuries. During the excavation, the
                experts were able to uncover a definite water route on the earth.
                Finding the moment of this discovery particularly interesting,
                Athina created casting molds to preserve the impression that the
                movement of water had left on the landscape at a certain point in
                time. A fragile trace on soil formed by humidity, yet it survived
                for centuries and is now exposed only to become ephemeral.</p>
              <p>The molds created form a site specific installation that
                represents the inverse or negative impressions of two distinct
                spots and were created in 3 different moments. When the
                archaeologists exposed the layer of the trace, the first set of
                molds was produced and recorded the movement of water as a
                negative trace as close as possible to the original time period in
                which it existed. A few days later, at the same two spots, but
                after certain acts by the archaeologists had been completed, the
                second and third set of molds were made. Thus these sets of molds
                document both the passage of water in the distant past as well as
                human behavior during a brief period of time in the present.</p>
              <p>They were presented as fragments on site, which is what they
                finally are. These "fragments" address the presence of a moving
                substance with the same care that stable humanmade structures hold
                in an excavation trench but also record the transformation of the
                landscape because of that movement.</p>
              
              
              <p class="rsmallp">The project was realized in collaboration with Alexandros Khan,
                was funded by the European Union and implemented by the
                Goethe-Institut,</p>
              <p class="rsmallp">realized in collaboration with ECeC laboratory</p>
              <p class="rsmallp">under the scientific direction of Francesca Romana Fiano
                (University of Ferrara).</p>
