            <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>Athina, with a master's degree in Post-Industrial Design and Artistic Practices from the University of Thessaly, seamlessly integrates her expertise in antiquity restoration, post-industrial design, and fine arts with diverse fields like archaeological excavation, biology, philosophy, science fiction, and speculative design.</p>
            <p>Her research is centered on transitional sitesâ€”be it industrial zones, disaster-stricken areas, or archaeological sites. Applying archaeological principles, she examines the connections between elements in the face of change. Her installations, acting as speculative "material narratives," have been showcased at notable exhibitions, including A.antonopoulou Gallery, Dutch Design Week, and the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.</p>
            <p class="hidden">Athina has participated in art residencies in the Netherlands, Italy, and Greece, earning recognition from ARTWORKS (2022) and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Artist Support Program. In 2023, she secured European funding for an artistic research project during an ongoing excavation in Rome.</p>
            <p class="hidden">Currently based in Athens, she serves as a conservator of antiquities and artworks, contributing to excavation projects, museums, and cultural spaces. Simultaneously, she is actively engaged in an artist-run studio in central Athens, focusing on the production of visual and utilitarian objects.</p>
