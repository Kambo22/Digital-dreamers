            <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>Athina has studied Restoration and Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art at the UniWa, Athens and holds amaster degree in Post industrial Design and Artistic Practices from the University of Thessaly, Volos.
                Her practice is based on an artistic research method she has developed, merging her background in antiquity restoration, post industrial design and fine arts with the fields of the archeological excavation, biology, philosophy, science fiction and speculative design.               
                Her research focus is on sites that are going through transition or a drastic change.                
                Whether this is an industrial area, a natural disaster area or an archaeological excavation, she applies archaeological principles and methodologies to locate the elements involved and trace the connections between them. Focusing on the strange new balances and adaptation to change, she explores the new ecosystems that evolve while discussing material culture and the living landscape.
                Her installations act as speculative “material narratives” exploring materiality while offering various potential interpretations.
                She works in a cooperative artist's studio in the center of Athens. In recent years she has worked in various restoration and excavation projects all around Greece, as artist's assistant in exhibitions, prop maker in theater productions  while at the same time she practices nomadic beekeeping. In 2022 she was awarded the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Artist Fellowship by ARTWORKS (2022).
